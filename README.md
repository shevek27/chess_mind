# chess_mind

Standard chess bot, trying to get it to the point that it can beat me (1200 in chess.com rapid) and beyond.

## Featues

- **Position Evaluation**: Rudimentary evaluation function.
- **Game Tree Search**: Explore and evaluate multiple move paths. Trying to implement alpha-beta pruning.
- **Python Integration**: Built using `python-chess` for the chess basics and `pygame` for interface and sounds.

## TO DO
- Improve the search function, use GPU.
- Improve the evaluation function.
- Implement a neural network for better evaluation (future).
